# JSONCrypt
The JSONCrypt library is specifically used for encrypting and decrypting data that is sent and received between a client and a server. This library can be easily used by budding programmers to secure their data transmission. The library makes use of 128 bit AES encryption of data, followed by either RSA encryption or developer specified custom encryption of the AES key. This grants the user absolute right to control and manage the security of their data. Further, a user is entitled to various methods of creating an AES key for encryption. Library users include both J2EE and Android developers working extensively on server request and response.
